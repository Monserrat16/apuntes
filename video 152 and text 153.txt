To deploy your app to heroku, first check git status to ensure you don't have any uncommitted code, if you do, make a commit of it

Then deploy to heroku:

git push heroku master

Then run any pending migrations in heroku:

heroku run rake db:migrate

Dont forget to post a link for your heroku app to the discussion area!!! This step is very important

Homework assignment:
